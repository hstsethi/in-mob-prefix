Phone numbers in India are a set of unique 10 digit numbers. Out of which, first 4 are network operator/circle code. Last six are random. This is a dataset of first four numbers with their respective state, operator name.

Note: Starting from commit ``, the dataset is refractored to contain only 3 columns: Series, Operator, Circle. This makes it easier to use/read and eliminates duplicate columns name.

Note: This dataset is provided "as-is" without any warranty of any kind. While I have personally fixed many errors, I still can't guarantee that this dataset is accurate. Use at your own risk.
